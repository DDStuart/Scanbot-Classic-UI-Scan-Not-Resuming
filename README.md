# Scanbot-Classic-UI-Scan-Not-Resuming

This demos a bug in the classic UI component where it doesn't resume scanning barcodes when navigating back to the page.

- For iOS going to the NextPage, then back to MainPage once will show the bug.
- For Android, you will need to use the next/back buttons repeatedly to trigger the bug.
